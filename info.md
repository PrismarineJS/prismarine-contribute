PrismarineJS is a Github organization that hosts a number of Minecraft-related projects written for Node.js. The projects include:
* mineflayer - a high-level library for creating Minecraft Java Edition bots
* node-minecraft-protocol (npm: minecraft-protocol) - a protocol library that developers can use to create their own Minecraft clients or servers. node-minecraft-protocol (nmp) isn't designed for casual use as it requires a deep understanding of the Minecraft protocol and alot of boilerplate code to work with.
* bedrock-protocol - a protocol library for Minecraft Bedrock Edition, with same caveats as nmp
* node-minecraft-data (npm: minecraft-data) - a Node.js library that exposes data that exists inside the langauge-agnostic PrismarineJS/minecraft-data repo. node-minecraft-data is known as minecraft-data on the npm registry. The minecraft-data repo holds JSON files describing Minecraft items, blocks, recipes, entities, the schema for Minecraft Java and Bedrock Edition packets, and more
* prismarine-nbt - a library for reading and writing Minecraft NBT data
* prismarine-biome - a small library for reading and writing Minecraft biome data
* prismarine-block - a library for working with Minecraft block data. prismarine-block exposes a Block class that can hold instances of block data
* prismarine-chat - a library for parsing and serializing Minecraft chat messages
* prismarine-chunk - a library for reading and writing Minecraft chunk data
* prismarine-entity - a small library that holds an Entity class for working with Minecraft entities
* prismarine-item - a library for working with Minecraft item data. prismarine-item exposes an Item class that can hold instances of item data
* prismarine-nbt - a library for reading and writing Minecraft NBT data
* prismarine-physics - a library for working with Minecraft physics
* prismarine-recipe - a small library for working with Minecraft recipes
* prismarine-registry - a library that can be used to create an "instance" of minecraft-data for a specific version of Minecraft. This is helpful when the data needs to be mutated in some way for a specific session
* prismarine-windows - a library for working with Minecraft inventories
* prismarine-world - a library that holds a World class for working with Minecraft worlds

Almost all the PrismarineJS packages support multi-versioning, meaning they are capable of supporting a wide range of Minecraft versions.
mineflayer and node-minecraft-protocol currently support all Minecraft Java Edition versions beyond 1.8.
minecraft-data has data for this and some earlier versions of Minecraft Java Edition, as well as data for Minecraft Bedrock Edition. bedrock-protocol supports all versions after 1.16. And obviously, when a new version of Minecraft is released, the PrismarineJS packages may need to be updated to support the new version, so they may not immediately support the latest version of Minecraft without an update.

And some non-PrismarineJS packages, but relevant to PrismarineJS:
* protodef - a Node.js library for binary protocol serialization/de-serialization that is used by nmp and bedrock-protocol. ProtoDef's compiler can take in a JSON schema for a binary protocol and use that to generate JavaScript code to serialize and deserialize the protocol packets
* vec3 - a small library for working with 3D vectors

Here are some explainations about the dependencies:
* mineflayer - Mineflayer depends on the `mineflayer-pathfinder, prismarine-chat, prismarine-windows, prismarine-registry, prismarine-physics, prismarine-recipe, prismarine-registry, prismarine-world, prismarine-entity, prismarine-item, prismarine-nbt, prismarine-block, prismarine-chunk, prismarine-biome, minecraft-data, node-minecraft-protocol, protodef, vec3` packages. Mineflayer's API can be extended by creating plugins that use these packages. Notably, this includes:
  * mineflayer-pathfinder - a mineflayer plugin for A* pathfinding
* node-minecraft-protocol - Node-minecraft-protocol depends primarily on the `protodef` and `minecraft-data` packages. minecraft-data mainly to access protocol schemas
* bedrock-protocol - Bedrock-protocol similarly depends on the `protodef` package and `minecraft-data`
* node-minecraft-data - https://github.com/prismarinejs/node-minecraft-data has a submodule that points to the language-agnostic `PrismarineJS/minecraft-data` repo
